# Smart Fixed Deposit Customer Targeting System

## 📌 Overview
This project helps banks decide **which customers to contact for Fixed Deposit (FD) offers** so that they can increase deposits while reducing unnecessary calls.

Instead of contacting all customers, the system predicts **who is likely to open an FD because of the call**, and recommends only those customers.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Banks spend significant time and money contacting customers for FD offers. Many customers either:
- Are not interested, or
- Would have invested even without being contacted

This leads to wasted effort and lower profitability.
